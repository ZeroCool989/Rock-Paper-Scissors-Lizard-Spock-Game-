# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game

## Introduction
Welcome to my version of the **Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock** game! This project is a fun and interactive web application built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a twist on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game by including two additional choices: Spock and Lizard.

## Game Rules
The game extends the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors with two more choices, making it more unpredictable and fun. The rules are as follows:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock

Players compete against the computer, choosing from rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or spock. The winner is determined based on the above rules.

## Features

### 1. Header and Logo
The top section of the game displays the title hero image. It's designed to give users an immediate understanding of the game.

### 2. Game Selection
This central part of the website allows players to choose their move. Each option (rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or spock) is represented by an interactive button. This interactive segment is the core of the gameplay experience.

### 3. Results Section
After making a selection, this area displays the outcome of the game â€“ whether the player won, lost, or tied. It also keeps track of the player's ongoing score against the computer.
